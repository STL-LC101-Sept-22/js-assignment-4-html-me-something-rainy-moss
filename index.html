<h2>Meet Karlo</h2>
   
   <p>Karl for short. He’s an 11-year-old Siberian Husky-Malamute Mix (we think), but underneath the double-coat of fur, he is clearly human. But no need to take my word for it. You can see the evidence for yourself.</p>

<!-- Here are the top 10 signs Karl is actually a human inside of a dog’s body:

He requires a pillow at all times, regardless of quality, shape or intended purpose
He gets lost in deep thought
He’s choosy with his friends, but the real ones are his BFFs
He has hands
He is a dainty eater
He understands his camera angles 
He has dolls
He can drive
He looks good in hats
He is a talented singer -->
